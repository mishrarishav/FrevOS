This snapshot distinguishes target architecture from implemented software. The
documents describe intended boundaries; they do not prove runtime enforcement.

## Completed Phase 0A

The merged foundation establishes:

- repository-wide engineering and agent instructions;
- FrevOS product definition and system boundaries;
- phased delivery roadmap with a Phase 3 UI reference gate;
- security threat model and permission/approval model;
- repository topology, isolation, model, tool, release, and approval ADRs;
- this factual state and decision register.

Phase 0A introduced no application runtime.

## Completed Phase 1

The merged foundation introduces:

- Node.js 24 LTS, TypeScript 7, pnpm 11, native ESM, and strict compiler rules;
- one provider-neutral `@frevos/contracts` package;
- strict identifiers, workspace/project scopes, permissions, risk, approval
  bindings, safe validation results, and JSON Schema exports;
- Vitest unit tests with enforced coverage thresholds;
- Biome formatting and linting;
- repository documentation and desired-ruleset validation;
- read-only, commit-pinned GitHub Actions CI and grouped Dependabot proposals;
- exact dependencies, a frozen lockfile, and high-severity audit enforcement.

No UI, API, authentication, persistence, queue, worker, GitHub App, MCP, model,
Playwright, cloud infrastructure, artifact, or deployment capability is added.

PR [#2](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS/pull/2) passed its exact-head
pull-request CI, was human squash-merged as `72bbcb4`, and then passed the
default-branch `CI / validate` run. The active ruleset now requires that stable
check and an up-to-date branch.

## Completed Phase 2

The merged independent `FrevOS-Acceptance` foundation introduces:

- separate repository and test-maintenance governance;
- Playwright desktop/mobile Chromium and axe-core accessibility foundations;
- fixture/preview/UAT environment validation with Production and credentials
  denied;
- a synthetic loopback fixture clearly separated from product acceptance;
- semantic, responsive, console, network-failure, and accessibility checks;
- retained-on-failure screenshot, trace, and video evidence plus HTML, JSON, and
  JUnit reports;
- automated rejection of production source coupling, skipped/focused tests,
  arbitrary sleeps, forced interactions, and weak assertions;
- read-only pinned CI, frozen dependencies, short artifact retention, and
  desired branch governance.

Acceptance PR [#1](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS-Acceptance/pull/1)
passed its exact-head CI, was human squash-merged as `087f85e`, and passed
default-branch
[Acceptance CI run 31363238909](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS-Acceptance/actions/runs/31363238909).
The active Acceptance ruleset requires the stable up-to-date `validate` check.

No FrevOS UI behavior is claimed or tested because the Phase 3 Lovable source
and screen contract have not been supplied.

## Accepted foundation decisions

- The product and primary repository are named FrevOS.
- `mishrarishav/FrevOS` is the production modular monorepo.
- `mishrarishav/FrevOS-Acceptance` is independent black-box QA.
- Customer repositories remain external and use ephemeral isolated checkouts.
- Project resources and memory are workspace scoped.
- Agents use controlled business tools and have no ambient authority.
- Model integration is provider neutral at the domain boundary.
- UAT and Production promote the same immutable artifact digest.
- Sensitive actions require exact, single-use human approval.
- A separate allowlisted Windows agent performs deterministic deployment.
- The foundation uses Node.js 24 LTS, pnpm 11, TypeScript 7, Biome, and Vitest.
- Zod schemas are the runtime source of truth for shared boundary contracts.
- CI runs the same validation with read-only permissions and immutable actions.
- Independent acceptance uses a separate black-box Playwright repository and a
  synthetic self-test that cannot be represented as product acceptance.
- The approved Phase 3 UI reference is pinned by repository ID and exact commit;
  it governs experience only and cannot own production architecture.
- The Control Center experience uses React 19, Vite 8, TypeScript 7, semantic
  CSS tokens, and deterministic demonstration data.
- The future control-plane service boundary uses Fastify 5 on Node.js 24.
- Browser authentication uses a provider-neutral OpenID Connect BFF with
  server-side opaque sessions and no provider tokens in browser storage.
- Tenant persistence uses PostgreSQL with application authorization,
  workspace-scoped repositories, composite workspace foreign keys, and forced
  row-level security as independent defenses.

The ADR index records the rationale and consequences of these decisions.

## Completed Phase 3

The merged Phase 3 foundation introduces:

- `apps/control-center` as the first product experience runtime;
- desktop and mobile shell navigation, Control Center, and design-system
  surfaces;
- local command palette, workspace switching, Agent Activity, command composer,
  and state-gallery interactions;
- planned destinations for later route vocabulary without implementing those
  capabilities;
- an exact UI source contract and web-foundation ADR.

Phase 3 does not introduce authentication, APIs, persistence, integrations,
authorization enforcement, real agent execution, approvals, audit storage,
artifacts, deployments, secrets, or Production access.

Core PR [#5](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS/pull/5) passed exact-head
CI at `088bbb670637bf3519e60cc9fc9208d0f4300fb9`, was human squash-merged as
`13f3cd22d9e82b1cf0b8a65621aeb9342b402698`, and passed default-branch
[CI run 31380728718](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS/actions/runs/31380728718).
The merged task branch was deleted. Deployed Preview or UAT product acceptance
remains unavailable and is not claimed.

## Active Phase 4A

After the human Phase 3 merge, the user authorized the Phase 4A publication
workflow. The `phase/4-auth-workspace-foundation` branch is based directly on
the verified Phase 3 squash commit on `main`.

The bounded Phase 4A slice owns architecture decisions, strict identity,
session, workspace, membership, client, and project contracts, plus
deterministic workspace authorization and negative unit tests. It does not
claim an HTTP, OIDC, cookie, database, RLS, or UI-integration runtime. See
[Phase 4 Authentication and Workspace Foundation](PHASE_4_FOUNDATION.md).

The rebased Phase 4A tree passed `pnpm run ci` on 2026-08-10: repository
validation, formatting, lint, type-check, 70 tests, enforced coverage, package
and UI production builds, and the high-severity dependency audit all completed
successfully. No Phase 4 dependency was added. Pull-request CI on the published
exact head remains the canonical clean-environment gate.

## Open decision register

These are deliberate blockers to implementing the affected phases, not blockers
to completing Phase 0A:

| Decision | Needed by | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud provider and regional/data-residency strategy | Before Phase 4 runtime deployment | Cost, availability, compliance, worker and networking requirements |
| OIDC deployment provider and assurance policy | Before Phase 4 runtime deployment | Tenant model, MFA, lifecycle, recovery, audit, regional, and commercial requirements |
| PostgreSQL hosting and operating model | Before Phase 4 runtime deployment | Regional isolation, backups, recovery, encryption, connection pooling, and operational ownership |
| Queue, worker runtime, retry, and cancellation semantics | Phase 7 | Persistence, idempotency, isolation, workload and cost model |
| GitHub App permission and webhook matrix | Phase 5 | Least-privilege mapping for every onboarding/workflow action |
| Worker sandbox and network-egress controls | Phase 5/8 | Threat model, supported builds, secret and artifact boundaries |
| Tool schema/versioning and policy engine design | Phase 6 | Compatibility, denial behavior, audit and approval integration |
| Model provider eligibility and project data classification | Phase 7 | Privacy, retention, regional, capability and cost requirements |
| Artifact store, provenance, SBOM, and signing | Phase 9 | Integrity, retention, access, promotion and verification model |
| Windows agent transport and device identity | Phase 10 | Outbound connectivity, authentication, rotation and recovery |
| Project-memory store, provenance, and freshness | Phase 12 | Retrieval quality, tenant isolation, deletion and retention |
| Outlook and Calendar consent scopes | Phase 15 | Minimum permissions, admin consent, retention and send approvals |
| Audit/evidence retention and private security reporting | Before Production | Legal, privacy, operational and incident-response requirements |
| Automation identity and independent reviewer model | Phase 5/8 | Separate bot/App identity, human reviewer ownership, and least-privilege GitHub scopes |

## Known limitations

- The Phase 3 application is a client-only demonstration shell; no API,
  persistence, authentication, or deployment behavior exists yet.
- Phase 4A contracts and authorization unit tests do not prove an authentication
  service or database isolation; real OIDC and PostgreSQL tests remain Phase 4B
  release gates.
- Phase 1 implements contract and CI guardrails only; it does not implement the
  later runtime authorization, isolation, approval, audit, or deployment controls.
- Phase 2 has no product-facing tests because no approved executable UI exists.
- Chromium emulation does not prove Firefox, WebKit, or physical-device behavior.
- External preview/UAT execution and authenticated browser state are not yet
  authorized or validated.
- Quantitative service objectives and compliance requirements are not defined.
- The current GitHub integration token can read repository rulesets but returns
  `403 Resource not accessible by integration` for ruleset and merge-setting
  writes. The human owner successfully applied and verified the current baseline.

## Readiness rule

Phases 0A through 3 are complete. Browser product acceptance follows only when
an authorized Preview or UAT target exists. Phase 4A may be proposed for human
review after exact-branch local validation, complete diff review, and clean
pull-request CI; its contracts do not satisfy the Phase 4 runtime exit.
