This snapshot distinguishes target architecture from implemented software. The
documents describe intended boundaries; they do not prove runtime enforcement.

## Completed Phase 0A

The merged foundation establishes:

- repository-wide engineering and agent instructions;
- FrevOS product definition and system boundaries;
- phased delivery roadmap with a Phase 3 UI reference gate;
- security threat model and permission/approval model;
- repository topology, isolation, model, tool, release, and approval ADRs;
- this factual state and decision register.

Phase 0A introduced no application runtime.

## Completed Phase 1

The merged foundation introduces:

- Node.js 24 LTS, TypeScript 7, pnpm 11, native ESM, and strict compiler rules;
- one provider-neutral `@frevos/contracts` package;
- strict identifiers, workspace/project scopes, permissions, risk, approval
  bindings, safe validation results, and JSON Schema exports;
- Vitest unit tests with enforced coverage thresholds;
- Biome formatting and linting;
- repository documentation and desired-ruleset validation;
- read-only, commit-pinned GitHub Actions CI and grouped Dependabot proposals;
- exact dependencies, a frozen lockfile, and high-severity audit enforcement.

No UI, API, authentication, persistence, queue, worker, GitHub App, MCP, model,
Playwright, cloud infrastructure, artifact, or deployment capability is added.

PR [#2](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS/pull/2) passed its exact-head
pull-request CI, was human squash-merged as `72bbcb4`, and then passed the
default-branch `CI / validate` run. The active ruleset now requires that stable
check and an up-to-date branch.

## Completed Phase 2

The merged independent `FrevOS-Acceptance` foundation introduces:

- separate repository and test-maintenance governance;
- Playwright desktop/mobile Chromium and axe-core accessibility foundations;
- fixture/preview/UAT environment validation with Production and credentials
  denied;
- a synthetic loopback fixture clearly separated from product acceptance;
- semantic, responsive, console, network-failure, and accessibility checks;
- retained-on-failure screenshot, trace, and video evidence plus HTML, JSON, and
  JUnit reports;
- automated rejection of production source coupling, skipped/focused tests,
  arbitrary sleeps, forced interactions, and weak assertions;
- read-only pinned CI, frozen dependencies, short artifact retention, and
  desired branch governance.

Acceptance PR [#1](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS-Acceptance/pull/1)
passed its exact-head CI, was human squash-merged as `087f85e`, and passed
default-branch
[Acceptance CI run 31363238909](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS-Acceptance/actions/runs/31363238909).
The active Acceptance ruleset requires the stable up-to-date `validate` check.

No FrevOS UI behavior is claimed or tested because the Phase 3 Lovable source
and screen contract have not been supplied.

## Accepted foundation decisions

- The product and primary repository are named FrevOS.
- `mishrarishav/FrevOS` is the production modular monorepo.
- `mishrarishav/FrevOS-Acceptance` is independent black-box QA.
- Customer repositories remain external and use ephemeral isolated checkouts.
- Project resources and memory are workspace scoped.
- Agents use controlled business tools and have no ambient authority.
- Model integration is provider neutral at the domain boundary.
- UAT and Production promote the same immutable artifact digest.
- Sensitive actions require exact, single-use human approval.
- A separate allowlisted Windows agent performs deterministic deployment.
- The foundation uses Node.js 24 LTS, pnpm 11, TypeScript 7, Biome, and Vitest.
- Zod schemas are the runtime source of truth for shared boundary contracts.
- CI runs the same validation with read-only permissions and immutable actions.
- Independent acceptance uses a separate black-box Playwright repository and a
  synthetic self-test that cannot be represented as product acceptance.
- The approved Phase 3 UI reference is pinned by repository ID and exact commit;
  it governs experience only and cannot own production architecture.
- The Control Center experience uses React 19, Vite 8, TypeScript 7, semantic
  CSS tokens, and deterministic demonstration data.
- The future control-plane service boundary uses Fastify 5 on Node.js 24.
- Browser authentication uses a provider-neutral OpenID Connect BFF with
  server-side opaque sessions and no provider tokens in browser storage.
- Tenant persistence uses PostgreSQL with application authorization,
  workspace-scoped repositories, composite workspace foreign keys, and forced
  row-level security as independent defenses.

The ADR index records the rationale and consequences of these decisions.

## Completed Phase 3

The merged Phase 3 foundation introduces:

- `apps/control-center` as the first product experience runtime;
- desktop and mobile shell navigation, Control Center, and design-system
  surfaces;
- local command palette, workspace switching, Agent Activity, command composer,
  and state-gallery interactions;
- planned destinations for later route vocabulary without implementing those
  capabilities;
- an exact UI source contract and web-foundation ADR.

Phase 3 does not introduce authentication, APIs, persistence, integrations,
authorization enforcement, real agent execution, approvals, audit storage,
artifacts, deployments, secrets, or Production access.

Core PR [#5](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS/pull/5) passed exact-head
CI at `088bbb670637bf3519e60cc9fc9208d0f4300fb9`, was human squash-merged as
`13f3cd22d9e82b1cf0b8a65621aeb9342b402698`, and passed default-branch
[CI run 31380728718](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS/actions/runs/31380728718).
The merged task branch was deleted. Deployed Preview or UAT product acceptance
remains unavailable and is not claimed.

## Completed Phase 4A

Phase 4A added the accepted Fastify, OIDC BFF, and PostgreSQL RLS decisions;
strict identity, session, workspace, membership, client, and project contracts;
and deterministic workspace authorization with negative tests.

Core PR [#7](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS/pull/7) passed exact-head
`validate` at `e3c21fca6b669a5eb1e78a8f67a4e6a6bffdcd2c`, was human squash-merged as
`425c1f3e8b20dde798316b557341baa6c8aa8fb8`, and passed default-branch
[CI run 31381302149](https://github.com/mishrarishav/FrevOS/actions/runs/31381302149).
Its remote task branch was deleted.

## Active Phase 4B

The `phase/4b-control-plane-identity-storage` branch is based directly on the
verified Phase 4A squash commit. Its bounded implementation adds:

- a separately constructed Fastify BFF with bounded HTTP settings;
- provider-neutral OpenID Connect Authorization Code with PKCE, state, and nonce;
- encrypted pre-authentication state plus opaque, digest-backed, rotating,
  idle-limited, absolute-limited server sessions;
- same-origin, session-bound CSRF protection and hardened host cookies;
- PostgreSQL migrations and repositories for Phase 4 identity and workspace data;
- separate owner/runtime roles, transaction-local workspace context, forced RLS,
  membership-gated evidence resolution, and workspace-preserving foreign keys;
- real PostgreSQL 18.4 isolation and service integration tests.

The complete working tree passed `pnpm run ci` on 2026-08-10: repository and
format validation, lint, strict type-check, 87 tests with enforced coverage,
real PostgreSQL 18.4 isolation, all builds, and the high-severity dependency
audit completed successfully. Control-plane coverage was 97.87% statements,
93.23% branches, 98.75% functions, and 98.17% lines at that gate. The working
tree passed complete diff review. The branch remains local and unpublished;
push and pull-request creation require separate authorization.

## Open decision register

These are deliberate blockers to implementing the affected phases, not blockers
to completing Phase 0A:

| Decision | Needed by | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud provider and regional/data-residency strategy | Before Phase 4 runtime deployment | Cost, availability, compliance, worker and networking requirements |
| OIDC deployment provider and assurance policy | Before Phase 4 runtime deployment | Tenant model, MFA, lifecycle, recovery, audit, regional, and commercial requirements |
| PostgreSQL hosting and operating model | Before Phase 4 runtime deployment | Regional isolation, backups, recovery, encryption, connection pooling, and operational ownership |
| Queue, worker runtime, retry, and cancellation semantics | Phase 7 | Persistence, idempotency, isolation, workload and cost model |
| GitHub App permission and webhook matrix | Phase 5 | Least-privilege mapping for every onboarding/workflow action |
| Worker sandbox and network-egress controls | Phase 5/8 | Threat model, supported builds, secret and artifact boundaries |
| Tool schema/versioning and policy engine design | Phase 6 | Compatibility, denial behavior, audit and approval integration |
| Model provider eligibility and project data classification | Phase 7 | Privacy, retention, regional, capability and cost requirements |
| Artifact store, provenance, SBOM, and signing | Phase 9 | Integrity, retention, access, promotion and verification model |
| Windows agent transport and device identity | Phase 10 | Outbound connectivity, authentication, rotation and recovery |
| Project-memory store, provenance, and freshness | Phase 12 | Retrieval quality, tenant isolation, deletion and retention |
| Outlook and Calendar consent scopes | Phase 15 | Minimum permissions, admin consent, retention and send approvals |
| Audit/evidence retention and private security reporting | Before Production | Legal, privacy, operational and incident-response requirements |
| Automation identity and independent reviewer model | Phase 5/8 | Separate bot/App identity, human reviewer ownership, and least-privilege GitHub scopes |

## Known limitations

- The Phase 3 application is still a client-only demonstration shell and is not
  wired to the Phase 4B service; that experience integration is Phase 4C.
- Phase 4B has no selected production identity provider, cloud database,
  credential/key lifecycle, Preview/UAT deployment, or external acceptance.
- Phase 1 implements contract and CI guardrails only; it does not implement the
  later runtime authorization, isolation, approval, audit, or deployment controls.
- Phase 2 has no product-facing tests because no approved executable UI exists.
- Chromium emulation does not prove Firefox, WebKit, or physical-device behavior.
- External preview/UAT execution and authenticated browser state are not yet
  authorized or validated.
- Quantitative service objectives and compliance requirements are not defined.
- The current GitHub integration token can read repository rulesets but returns
  `403 Resource not accessible by integration` for ruleset and merge-setting
  writes. The human owner successfully applied and verified the current baseline.

## Readiness rule

Phases 0A through 3 and Phase 4A are complete. Phase 4B may be proposed for
human review only after exact-branch full validation and complete diff review.
Phase 4C and browser product acceptance require a reviewed Phase 4B merge plus
an authorized Preview or UAT target; Phase 4 is not yet complete.
